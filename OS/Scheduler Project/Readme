Scheduler algorithms simulator

To run :
python scheduler.py [XML-file]

Capabilities :
Supports all major algorithm
Swap in/out processes in case of lack of enough memory
Reads input from an XML file
All types of IO supported
IO can run concurrently
Priority queue used in IO
Calculates process statistics ( wait time, etc. )

Sample output :
